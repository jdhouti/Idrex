||| Function to insert (k, v) into dictionary. If there was no

{-
We implement insert in a very straightforward way: We just add
the given pair as the head of the existing list. When we do a
lookup, we will search down the list and return the value (as
an option) for the first pair that matches the given key. that
is our implementation strategy.

||| Function to look up and return the value for a given key if
||| there is one. This function requires the ability to decide
||| whether the given key, k, is equal to keys in the dictionary;
||| therefore, as with list_eq, we need to constrain the key type
||| to be a type for which "eq" is defined, i.e., to be a type for
||| which there is an implementation of the "Eq" interface.
